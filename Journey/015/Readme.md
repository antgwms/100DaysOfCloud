# Introduction to Amazon Web services & EC2 instances

I'm currently studying the AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials that starts with 'Introduction to Amazon Web Service' the Cloud Compute with EC2 servicer instances and dependancies.

From this point onwards I am not even going to try updating a readme everyday because daily is too much of a commitment, although I'll continue with study and record progress. 

## Prerequisite

IT knowledge is helpful, however AWS Training is informative using analogy and visual information which makes it easier to consume, regardless of your starting level.

## Cloud progress

Module 1: Introduction to AWS - short and sweet

Module 2: Compute in the Cloud - introduces EC2 server instances:

1. EC2 Types
2. Amazon EC2 Pricing
3. EC2 Scaling 
4. EC2 Load Balancing

Halfway throgh Module 2.

## Use Case

EC2 can be used for hosting services, such as websites or private server for games.
